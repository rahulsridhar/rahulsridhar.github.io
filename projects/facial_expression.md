The goal of this project was to classify the expression portrayed in a face as one of seven categories - Happy, Surprise, Sad, Neutral, Disgust, Anger, Fear. The data was sourced from [Kaggle]. I implemented a gradient boosted ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks and a K-nearest neighbors model after reducing dimensionality using Principal Components Analysis to predict the facial expressions (using Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, GraphLab)
