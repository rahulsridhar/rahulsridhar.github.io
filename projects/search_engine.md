![Search Engine](../files/search_image.png?raw=true)

This was a group project that I had worked on as part of my graduate-level Information Retrieval course. The goal was to build a search engine for the UCI Computer Science Department\'s <a href="http://ics.uci.edu/">website</a>. The project was split into multiple phases - scraping, tokenizing, indexing, ranking, retrieval, and finally validation.

The summaries from three different milestones of the project can be downloaded <a href="../files/search_milestone_summaries.zip">here</a>. The code for the entire project can be downloaded <a href="../files/search_codes.zip">	here</a>.
