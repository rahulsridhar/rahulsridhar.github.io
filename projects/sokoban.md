This was a group project I had worked on as part of my graduate-level Artificial Intelligence course. The goal was to build a system to solve Sokoban, a transporation-puzzle where a single agent has to move <i>n</i> boxes to their respective locations. We built a system using different search strategies such as A&#42;, Iterative Deepening A&#42;, Breadth First Search, and heuristics such as the Manhattan distance.
