## About Me

<img src="/portfolio/files/Me.jpg" alt="Rahul Sridhar" align="left" valign="middle" vspace="5" hspace="12" height="250" width="200"/>

I'm Rahul Sridhar, a Machine Learning practitioner and Data Scientist. The experience I gained by working on my undergraduate research project, "Emotion Identification of Songs", has been instrumental in motivating me to build a career in Machine Learning. My stint at Mu Sigma, one of the world\'s largest decision sciences firms, has further enabled me to understand the challenges in building data-centric solutions to real-world problems. Furthermore, my summer internship at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, working alongside top research scientists on areas such as deep learning, graph signal processing, influence analysis, transfer learning, and much more, has further chiseled my problem solving and machine learning skills. Further details about my education, experience, and more can be seen below. 	<br>
